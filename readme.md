## Controlling planes

### Getting the plane into the air

- Turn on the engine by pressing and holding the `R` key
- Hold the `B` key to brake
- While holding the `B` key, hold the `I` key to increase your throttle
- Release the `B` key and let the plane accelerate to a speed that's high enough to lift the plane
- Steer by pressing the `A` and `D` key
- Press the `S` key to lift up and the `W` key to fly down

### Landing the plane

- Turn down the throttle by pressing `K`
- Try to fly as slow as possible towards the runway without stalling the plane
- When close to the runway try to decrease your vertical speed
- When touching the ground, immediately turn down the throttle to 0%, without turning off the engine in case you need to take off if the runway is too short, or you are too fast
- Press and hold the `B` key until you stand still

## Naming Planes

You can name a plane by naming the plane item in an anvil.

## Picking up Planes

Planes can be picked up by hitting them with a plane wrench.
The wrench will lose half of its durability when breaking a plane.

## Repairing planes

Planes can be repaired by holding right-click on the plane with a plane wrench.
This will slowly decrease the damage value.

## Plane GUI

You can open a GUI containing the planes internal storage and some information about the plane by pressing the `P` key when sitting in a plane.
Note that this GUI isn't available in the Bush plane as it has no storage space.

You can also access this GUI on the normal plane by sneaking and right-clicking it.

The external inventory of the cargo plane can be accessed by sneaking and right-clicking it.

Every plane has an overlay displaying useful information about the flight.
You can disable it by pressing `CTRL` + `P`. You can also change the scale in the client config.
The speed units can also be changed in the client config. 
Possible units are kilometers per hour (`km/h`) and blocks per second (`b/s`).
